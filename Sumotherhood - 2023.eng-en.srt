(MUSIC CONCLUDES)
I know you're not talking
to me like that!

735
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:41,616
That's it. Everyone over here
like one big happy family.

736
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:44,285
Are you deaf, cuz?
I said get down on the floor.

737
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:45,452
Do your ting, innit.

738
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:47,187
But man ain't getting
on no floor.

739
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:49,323
Fam, man ain't asking like
to say if man wanted

740
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,760
a cup of tea or something,
man is giving orders, fam.

741
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:53,294
Like I'm a madman,
cuz, it's official.

742
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,496
Read about me.
I will leng it down in here.

743
00:29:55,697 --> 00:29:56,997
Please don't "leng"
anything down!

744
00:29:57,431 --> 00:29:59,768
Fuck me, how much longer's
this gonna take?

745
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,302
I got a 48 bus to catch!

746
00:30:01,368 --> 00:30:04,271
This is just spectacular.
Proper spectacular robbery, cuz.

747
00:30:04,338 --> 00:30:06,340
Everyone shut your mouth,
I swear down, man!

748
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,976
Nah, I swear I recognize your
little whiney street rat voice

749
00:30:09,043 --> 00:30:11,945
from somewhere.
(IN DEEPER VOICE) I told you,
you don't know me, man.

750
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,080
I don't think
you're getting this.

751
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,116
I'm a roadman
for life. Click-clack!

752
00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:17,786
Hold on a minute, fam.
(IN NORMAL VOICE) What?

753
00:30:17,918 --> 00:30:18,952
Am I going mad?

754
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:20,588
Why have you got two guns
and man's only got one?

755
00:30:21,021 --> 00:30:22,990
You really doing this
right now, fam?
RIKO: Yes, I'm doing
this right now.

756
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,192
What gives you the right to have
two guns and man's only got one?

757
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:27,227
I couldn't get you two, innit.
I could only get three so--

758
00:30:27,294 --> 00:30:29,096
So, why d'you get two then?
I wanted two.

759
00:30:29,163 --> 00:30:30,565
I'm the one holding
the hostages, fam.

760
00:30:30,632 --> 00:30:31,733
Why d'you get two and I didn't?

761
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,400
Why fam, why?
Riko, you're bugging out, G.

762
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:35,269
Oh, my gosh, you just said
my name, fam.

763
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:36,303
What? No I didn't!

764
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:37,971
Yes, you did, you just said
my name, Riko.

765
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:39,306
Why would you say
your own name for?

766
00:30:39,373 --> 00:30:41,108
I only said my name
'cause you said my name first.

767
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:42,744
What are you, some kind of
snitch or something?

768
00:30:42,811 --> 00:30:44,278
Sounds like a snitch
to me, mate!

769
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:45,312
I'm not a snitch!

770
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:47,649
And I didn't say your name, fam.
You did, innit?

771
00:30:47,782 --> 00:30:48,683
Innit? He said my name.

772
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:52,386
Question! Is this a joke?
Oh, my days!

773
00:30:52,486 --> 00:30:56,857
Shut the fuck up
and count my money, bitch!

774
00:30:57,257 --> 00:30:59,126
If I said your name,
it was an accident.

775
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:00,729
I'm sorry, all right?
All right, cool, bro.

776
00:31:00,795 --> 00:31:03,163
What if I say
your name then, cuz?
Why would you do that for?

777
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,566
'Cause it might be
an accident, innit?

778
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:07,935
This is some fucking joke ting.
Kane Patrick Armand Ketende!

779
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:08,936
What the fuck?

780
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:10,337
Why would you say
my full name for?

781
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:11,972
I'm sorry, bro,
it was an accident, innit?

782
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,974
Oh, okay, okay,
you wanna play games, yeah?

783
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:16,076
All right. (CACKLES) Check this.

784
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:18,847
Richard Oshlam Byaseff Bulouck.
Oh, my God, fam.

785
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:20,447
Don't call me Richard,
cuz! I told you.

786
00:31:20,515 --> 00:31:22,149
You know I don't like
when people call me Richard!

787
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:23,852
What you gonna do 'bout it?
What you gonna do 'bout it?

788
00:31:23,917 --> 00:31:25,352
I could do a lot.
I could do a lot too.

789
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:26,788
Set pace then.
I'm setting pace, fam.

790
00:31:26,855 --> 00:31:29,256
Oh, my days!

791
00:31:29,691 --> 00:31:31,191
You baited up your face, fam.
What?

792
00:31:31,392 --> 00:31:33,494
You ain't wearing your bally.
You ain't wearing
your bally either, man.

793
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:35,963
(GASPS) This is all your fault!
Stop repeating me, man!

794

You two clowns,
course it is! (LAUGHS)

796
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:44,739
Who else would rob a bank
like this, but Riko and Kane?

797
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:46,608
(CACKLES) Idiots!

798
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:48,942
Look what you done!
Look what I done? You mean,
look what you done!

799
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:50,779
You started this by saying
my name first, fam.

800

Richard Oshlam Byaseff Bulouck.

801
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:56,383
Such a good boy,
always so polite and friendly.

802
00:31:56,483 --> 00:31:57,519
What's happened to you?

803
00:31:57,685 --> 00:32:01,054
He's that fucking weirdo
that got himself sectioned.

804
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:02,356
Oh, yeah, I read about that.

805
00:32:02,557 --> 00:32:04,491
It's bipolar, all right?
And that's why I'm doing this.

806
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,927
To show everyone
with mental health problems

807
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:08,328
that you can do anything
you put your mind to.

808
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:10,931
Even a bank robbery.
Believe and achieve.

809
00:32:10,998 --> 00:32:12,099
You can do anything.

810
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:15,235
Believe and achieve.
(CHUCKLES) That's sick.

811
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:20,742
I mean, it is very inspiring.

You man need
to hurry the fuck up.

Man has got places to go.
I know!

815

How long is this going to take?

818
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:36,190
I've left my bicycle out there
and it's not even locked.

819
00:32:36,256 --> 00:32:38,091
I wouldn't leave my bike
unlocked around here, mate.

820
00:32:38,258 --> 00:32:39,193
Lot of criminals about.

821
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,361
(CHUCKLES)
I don't see criminals out here.

822
00:32:41,428 --> 00:32:43,363
I see young people
with no prospects,

823
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:46,734
no future and no hope.
It's not very surprising

824
00:32:46,901 --> 00:32:48,368
after ten years
of a Tory government.

825

What the fuck is this, man?
Everyone shut your mouth!

826
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:53,006
This is a fucking bank robbery.
Do you understand?

827
00:32:53,073 --> 00:32:54,542
I will start murking people
out here.

828

Allow it, wasteman.

829

who I am, fam?

I don't give a shit if
you was fucking Hercules, fam.

You need to be waiting
over there, cuz.

Shh, shh, fam,
you need to calm yourself

Oh, my gosh, do you not see
what man is holding, fam?

Trust me, you don't want it
with me.

Listen, I'm gonna
have to ask you

842
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,739
to sit over there,
you know, fam.

843

Now, ask about me.
What?

Are you mad? I don't give
a shit who you are.

855
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:58,973
All I'm saying is...
keep pointing that gun at me

856
00:33:59,273 --> 00:34:02,309
and I will shove it up
your fucking batty crease!

857

What? Ain't no one shoving
nothing up my bumbum-hole, cuz.

I'll smash your head
through that fucking window.

Go on then, shoot me.

The-- The gun ain't
even loaded, cuz.

Nah, man. We were just chatting
and I-- I dunno what--
